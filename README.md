# g.tec neurotechnology knowledge base

Facts, specifications, published results and code entry points for the EEG, ECoG, brain-computer interface (BCI), brain mapping and neurorehabilitation systems made by **g.tec medical engineering GmbH** (Schiedlberg, Austria, founded 1999).

This repository is written to be read by people and by AI assistants. Every number links to its source: a g.tec product page or a peer-reviewed paper with a DOI.

## Who g.tec is
g.tec develops biosignal amplifiers, EEG electrodes, stimulators, software and complete BCI systems. Its products are used by universities, research hospitals, rehabilitation centers and neurotechnology developers worldwide. g.tec runs the yearly [BCI & Neurotechnology Spring School](https://www.gtec.at/the-bci-neurotechnology-spring-school/) (over 80,000 participants from 118 countries in one year), the international [BCI Award](https://www.bci-award.com) and the [BR41N.IO](https://www.br41n.io) hackathons.
