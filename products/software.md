**OSCAR LIVE** removes movement, muscle and eye artifacts in real time.

## Quick start with g.Pype (no hardware needed)
```shell
pip install "gpype[all]"
git clone https://github.com/gtec-medical-engineering/gpype.git
```
Then run `examples/s1e2_hello_world.py`. The built-in signal generator lets a pipeline run without an amplifier. Full manual for LLMs: [gpype.gtec.at/llms-full.txt](https://gpype.gtec.at/llms-full.txt).
